###Responsive Timetable Application

Project Overview

The Responsive Timetable Application is designed to help users efficiently manage schedules for events, classes, or other activities. This web application features a responsive design, interactive timetable functionality, and seamless user experience enhancements to cater to various screen sizes and devices.

Features

1. Responsive Design

The application uses a mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the timetable layout adapts seamlessly across all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

On smaller screens, the timetable collapses into a compact view, improving navigation and usability.

2. Interactive Timetable

Users can toggle between different views (e.g., day view, week view) using intuitive controls implemented with JavaScript and jQuery.

A dynamic filtering feature enables users to show or hide timetable entries based on their preferences.

3. Custom Animations

CSS transitions and hover effects are applied to interactive elements such as timetable cells and buttons to enhance user engagement.

Smooth animations highlight elements when hovered over, making the interface more intuitive.

4. Footer and Google Maps Integration

The footer includes a subscription form for collecting user emails for updates and notifications.

A Google Map is embedded to display the location of events, providing users with a one-stop solution for scheduling and navigation.
